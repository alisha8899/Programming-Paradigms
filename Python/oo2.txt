For the Java implementation, I used the array for part a and I used an arraylist from the collections framework for part b. By using an ArrayList, I could have a re-sizable array and accomodate for extra elements if needed. It was easy to access. For part a, the array was a fixed size and did not allow for adding more elements. In Python, I fixed the size of a list and used append to increase the size. 

Overall, the Python code was easier to manage in one single file, whereas, the Java code required multiple files and more room for error. I will continue using Java for object oriented problems and Python for functional approaches. I did enjoy learning how to do both approaches for this assignment because it allowed me to see the differences and understand the pros and cons.
